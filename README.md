### Hi, I'm Hamza 👋🏽

_I'm a Full-Stack Developer with an affinity for building mobile apps.
I love to learn and am dedicated to refining my craft but not as dedicated as I am to the art of napping. 😅 When I'm not napping, I'm working at on some really cool things at [Taplytics](https://taplytics.com)._

- 🦁    **Fun fact** : When I was younger, I would watch Lion King non-stop, and when I wasn't watching the movie, I'd ask my parents to read me the plot line. I guess I just really liked hearing about talking lions. 🤷🏽‍♂️
