### Hi, I'm Hamza 👋🏽

_I'm a Full-Stack Developer with an affinity for building mobile apps.
I love to learn and am dedicated to refining my craft but not as dedicated as I am to the art of napping. 😅 When I'm not napping, I'm working on some really cool things at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/product/cash)._
