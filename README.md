### Hi, I'm Hamza 👋🏽

_I'm a Full-Stack Developer with an affinity for building mobile apps.
I love to learn and and have always been dedicated to refining my craft but not as dedicated as I am to the art of napping. 😅   When I'm not napping, I'm working on a really exciting venture called [Mydoh](https://mydoh.ca/) at [RBC Ventures](https://www.rbcventures.ca/en)._

- 🦁    **Fun fact** : When I was younger, I would watch Lion King non-stop, and when I wasn't watching the movie, I'd ask my parents to read me the plot line. I guess I just really liked hearing about talking lions. 🤷🏽‍♂️
